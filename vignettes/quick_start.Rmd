# Introduction

`TARDIS` offers an easy and straightforward way to automatically
calculate area under the peak, max intensity and various quality metrics
for targeted chemical compounds in LC-MS data. It makes use of an
established retention time correction algorithm from the `xcms` package
and loads MS data as `Spectra` objects so it's easily integrated with
other tools of the *Rformassspectrometry* initiative.

See
[README](https://github.com/pablovgd/T.A.R.D.I.S./blob/main/README.md)
for installation instructions.

This quick start guide will briefly demonstrate the main functionalities
of `TARDIS` using the command line interface. For details on the GUI we 
refer to the `gui_tutorial ` vignette. For more information we refer 
to the publication : https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.analchem.5c00567.

# File conversion

Input files need to be converted to the .mzML format and have to be centroided.
Polarity filtering is done within `TARDIS`, so no polarity subsetting has to be
performed when converting the files. For file conversion using MSConvert (ProteoWizard)
we refer to to mzmine documentation: https://mzmine.github.io/mzmine_documentation/data_conversion.html

# Loading data

The first step is creating a `data.frame` that describes the chemical
compounds. Following columns at least need to be present for each
compound:

-   A compound ID, a unique identifier
-   A compound Name
-   Theoretical or measured *m/z*
-   Expected RT (in minutes)
-   A column that indicates the polarity of the formed ion for that
    compound

Extra columns can be included in the file, but will be ignored by
`TARDIS` unless otherwise indicated.

An input file (either .xlsx or .csv) can be converted to a correct
data.frame using the `createTargetList()` function. 
Input parameters needed are: the path to the file, the
patterns for positive and negative ionization, the polarity of interest,
the columnn that contains the ionization mode and the other columns of
interest.

```{r echo=FALSE}
library(readxl)
input <- read_excel("vignette_data/targets.xlsx")
kableExtra::kable(head(input))
```

The target `data.frame` is created using `createTargetList()`.
For more info on how to use the function, check the help page: `?createTargetList`

```{r}
library(TARDIS)
targets <- createTargetList("vignette_data/targets.xlsx",
                            pos_pattern = "+",
                            neg_pattern = "-",
                            polarity = "positive",
                            ion_column = "ion",
                            columns_of_interest = c("id", "name", "mz", "rt"))

kableExtra::kable(head(targets))
```

The files in which the targets need to be detected are:

```{r}
list.files(path = "vignette_data/mzML/")
```
The files are ordered in the folder by injection index, in this case, we
have a total of 14 runs:two QC injections, followed by four sample injections, 
two QC injections, four sample injections and two QC injections. 

Alternatively, instead of using file paths as input for TARDIS, the user can
also use an `MsExperiment` object. Here it is necessary to include at least
sample type in the sampleData to distinguish QC from sample runs. 

**IMPORTANT!** The sampleData column has to be named `type`.


```{r warning=FALSE, message = FALSE}
library(MsExperiment)
files <- list.files(path = "vignette_data/mzML/",full.names = TRUE)
ms_data <- readMsExperiment(files,
                            backend = Spectra::MsBackendMzR())
```

```{r}
ms_data
```

```{r}
sampleData(ms_data)$type <- c("QC",
              "QC",
              "sample",
              "sample",
              "sample",
              "sample",
              "QC",
              "QC",
              "sample",
              "sample",
              "sample",
              "sample",
              "QC",
              "QC")
```

# Data with multiple scan windows

**IMPORTANT!** if your data contains multiple (overlapping) *m/z* scan windows,
it is necessary to analyze these separately through the "mass_range" argument. 
If not, you will notice that peaks will have a sawtooth profile, because of the
filtering of empty spectra within TARDIS. 

```{r,out.width="49%" }
knitr::include_graphics("vignette_data/plots/sawtooth.png")
```

# Screening mode

First, we perform a screening step to check if our targets are visible
within our *m/z* and RT windows.

I limited the selection to 10 targets: 5 internal standards and 5 endogenous
metabolites.

```{r}
targets = targets[targets$ID %in% c("1576","1577","1578","1583","331",
                            "7","9","131","179","183"),]
```

We can run screening mode using the argument `screening_mode = TRUE` in
the tardis_peaks function.

For more details on the inputs of the function, please read the help page
`?tardisPeaks`

```{r warning=FALSE}
results <- tardisPeaks(file_path = "vignette_data/mzML/",
                        dbData = targets,
                        mass_range = NULL,
                        polarity = "positive",
                        output_directory = "vignette_data/output/screening/",
                        batch_positions = list(c(1,14)),
                        QC_pattern = "QC",
                        int_std_id = c("1576","1577","1578","1583","331"),
                        screening_mode = TRUE)
```
Or, as mentioned, the MsExperiment object can be used as input instead.

```{r}
results <- tardisPeaks( lcmsData = ms_data, 
                        dbData = targets,
                        mass_range = NULL,
                        polarity = "positive",
                        output_directory = "vignette_data/output/screening/",
                        batch_positions = list(c(1,14)),
                        QC_pattern = "QC",
                        int_std_id = c("1576","1577","1578","1583","331"),
                        screening_mode = TRUE)
```


The resulting EICs are saved in the output folder and can be inspected:

```{r,out.width="49%" }
knitr::include_graphics(c("vignette_data/output/screening/Diagnostic_QCs_Batch_1/Component_7.png",
                         "vignette_data/output/screening/Diagnostic_QCs_Batch_1/Component_9.png",
                         "vignette_data/output/screening/Diagnostic_QCs_Batch_1/Component_131.png",
                         "vignette_data/output/screening/Diagnostic_QCs_Batch_1/Component_179.png",
                         "vignette_data/output/screening/Diagnostic_QCs_Batch_1/Component_183.png",
                         "vignette_data/output/screening/Diagnostic_QCs_Batch_1/Component_331.png",
                         "vignette_data/output/screening/Diagnostic_QCs_Batch_1/Component_1576.png",
                         "vignette_data/output/screening/Diagnostic_QCs_Batch_1/Component_1577.png",
                         "vignette_data/output/screening/Diagnostic_QCs_Batch_1/Component_1578.png",
                         "vignette_data/output/screening/Diagnostic_QCs_Batch_1/Component_1583.png"
                         ))
```

Based on the EICs we can see that detection and integration were successful, 
however,targets 1577 and 1583 are eluting towards the edge of our retention time
windows, so we'll adjust their expected retention times to the ones were we see
the peaks eluting.


```{r}
targets$tr[which(targets$ID == 1577)] <- 8.82 * 60
targets$tr[which(targets$ID == 1583)] <- 4 * 60
```

# Peak detection

Now we can perform peak detection in all our runs by setting 
`screening_mode =  FALSE`.


```{r warning=FALSE}
results <- tardisPeaks(lcmsData = ms_data,
                        dbData = targets,
                        mass_range = NULL,
                        polarity = "positive",
                        output_directory = "vignette_data/output/",
                        batch_positions = list(c(1,14)),
                        QC_pattern = "QC",
                        int_std_id = c("1576","1577","1578","1583","331"),
                        screening_mode = FALSE)
```
# Results

The resulting EICs are again saved in the output folder and can be inspected:

```{r,out.width="49%" }
knitr::include_graphics(c("vignette_data/output/Diagnostic_QCs_Batch_1/Component_7.png",
                         "vignette_data/output/Diagnostic_QCs_Batch_1/Component_9.png",
                         "vignette_data/output/Diagnostic_QCs_Batch_1/Component_131.png",
                         "vignette_data/output/Diagnostic_QCs_Batch_1/Component_179.png",
                         "vignette_data/output/Diagnostic_QCs_Batch_1/Component_183.png",
                         "vignette_data/output/Diagnostic_QCs_Batch_1/Component_331.png",
                         "vignette_data/output/Diagnostic_QCs_Batch_1/Component_1576.png",
                         "vignette_data/output/Diagnostic_QCs_Batch_1/Component_1577.png",
                         "vignette_data/output/Diagnostic_QCs_Batch_1/Component_1578.png",
                         "vignette_data/output/Diagnostic_QCs_Batch_1/Component_1583.png"
                         ))
```

The `results` object is a `list` that contains a `data.frame` with the AUC of
each target in each run and a `tibble` that contains a feature table with the 
average metrics for each target in the QC runs.

```{r}
kableExtra::kable(head(results[[1]]))

```


```{r}
kableExtra::kable(head(results[[2]]))

```

Other results include tables with the other metrics (Max. Int., SNR, peak_cor 
and points over the peak) and are saved into the output folder.

```{r}
maxint <- read.csv("vignette_data/output/int_table.csv",check.names = FALSE)
SNR <- read.csv("vignette_data/output/snr_table.csv",check.names = FALSE)
peak_cor <- read.csv("vignette_data/output/peakcor_table.csv",check.names = FALSE)
pop <- read.csv("vignette_data/output/pop_table.csv",check.names = FALSE)
```

```{r}
kableExtra::kable(head(pop))
```
